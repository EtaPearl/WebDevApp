# WebDevApp
An app to learn web development and some other concepts by a group of web enthusiasts.

# Features:
1. Learn Web Development
  - Backend Development
  - Frontend Development
2. News
3. Interview Questions
4. Quizzes

In each technology section for learning, there can be a short summary of what the technology is used in and what things can be achieved using it.
Then we can add three sections below that namely Tutorials, Videos, and Other References.

News section wherein we can make an aggregator to automatically pull news regarding the keywords related to web development (which will be controlled by us admins).

Then there will be interview questions for which answers will also be provided.

And finally there will be a quiz section (more detailing needed).

# Future scopes:
Using Machine learning and AI to recognize user queries related to web and provide closest answers to the queries being asked (somewhat like an Ask me anything bot for web development)
Also can think of NLP processing using google's NLP api to directly allow users to talk to bot instead of typing a query - like an assistant
News feed can be customized according to users usage of app using ML

**This is a community learning project and so anyone who wants to be a part of it, feel free to do so, it is your own project!
